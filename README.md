# Airplanes.Live Community Repository

This is the Airplanes.Live community repository for issues, feature requests, and roadmaps.

If you would like to request a feature, open a new issue and use the feature template. If you have an actual issue with the site, API, feeder image, etc., submit an issue and include as much information as possible.

The roadmap is under the Projects tab.
